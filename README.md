# EnergyChain Challenge

## Overview
The energy sector faces critical challenges, including energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability. Traditional energy systems suffer from monopolistic conditions, opaque carbon credit trading, and limited participation of small-scale renewable energy producers.

This project leverages **blockchain technology enhanced with ZK-SNARKs** to enable transparent, secure, and decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. By integrating **smart meters, IoT devices, and smart contracts**, the system ensures **real-time verification, efficient energy distribution, and privacy-preserving transactions**.

## Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
- **Decentralized Energy Trading:** Enable prosumers to directly participate in energy markets using blockchain-based verification.
- **Automated Carbon Credit Trading:** Develop a system with real-time verification to prevent double spending.
- **Smart Contract-Based Settlements:** Implement automated trading and settlement mechanisms.
- **IoT Integration:** Use smart meters to accurately monitor energy consumption.
- **Scalability & Accessibility:** Reduce barriers for small-scale renewable energy producers.
- **Privacy Protection:** Implement **ZK-SNARKs** to secure sensitive trading data.

## Key Features
- **Blockchain-Based Smart Grid:** Provides a transparent and immutable energy trading ecosystem.
- **P2P Energy Transactions:** Eliminates intermediaries, ensuring fair market participation.
- **IoT & Smart Meter Integration:** Tracks real-time energy usage efficiently.
- **Carbon Credit Verification:** Uses robust mechanisms to ensure authenticity.
- **Automated Order Matching & Settlement:** Smart contracts handle real-time energy trading.
- **Privacy-Preserving Technology:** ZK-SNARKs protect confidential transaction data.
